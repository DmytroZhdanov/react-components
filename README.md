# React-components

This repository serves as a fundamental framework for a React-based project. It provides a structured approach to implementing several key components within a single-page application.

## Features:
- **Component Integration**: Contains components like `<Profile>`, `<Statistics>`, `<FriendList>`, and `<TransactionHistory>`.
- **Data Handling**: Utilizes JSON files ('user.json', 'data.json', 'friends.json', 'transactions.json') to simulate and showcase various data representations.
- **Clean Component Structure**: Ensures each component resides in its dedicated folder with separate files for the component logic and styles.
- **Prop-Based Rendering**: Illustrates the passing of props to components for rendering dynamic content.
- **Responsive Styling**: Implements CSS modules or Styled Components for styling to ensure responsiveness and maintainability.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Offers a live preview of the application on GitHub Pages.

## Component Details:
- **Profile Component**: Displays user information fetched from 'user.json.'
- **Statistics Component**: Visualizes statistical data provided in 'data.json.'
- **FriendList Component**: Exhibits details of user friends retrieved from 'friends.json.'
- **TransactionHistory Component**: Represents transactional data sourced from 'transactions.json.'
